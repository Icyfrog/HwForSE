# Native App、Web App & Hybrid App

<br/>

### Basical introduction for three classificationss for App

<br/>

####  ● Native App

​	Native App is a kind of third party application, which is based on the cell phones' operation system such as iOS, Android and WP and also called as local App.

​	Reference from Wiki:  *Native apps or "mobile apps" run directly on a mobile device, just as a conventional software application runs directly on a desktop computer, without a web browser (and potentially without the need for Internet connectivity); these are typically written in Java (for Android devices) or Objective-C or Swift (for iOS devices). Recently, frameworks like React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and FuseTools allow the development oof native apps for all platforms using languages other than each standard native language.*

#### ● Web App

​	Web App is bulit on the based of web's system and application, and running on the Internet and browsers.

​	Reference from Wiki: *A web application or web app is a client–server computer program which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, and online auction.*1![img](https://timgsa.baidu.com/timg?image&quality=80&size=b9999_10000&sec=1541341310&di=f289e46b63b1041f261087335f3cc46a&imgtype=jpg&er=1&src=http%3A%2F%2Fdxssrr2j0sq4w.cloudfront.net%2F3.2.0%2Fimg%2Fhomepage%2Fwebapp.png)

​	About responsive web design, there is a picture showing something interesting. *Content is like water, a saying that illutrates the principles of RWD*

#### ● Hybrid App

​	As the name suggests, Hybrid App merges Native App and Web App to perform better for users.

​	Reference from Wiki:  *Hybrid apps embed a mobile web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework like Apache Cordova and Ionic or Appcelerator Titanium. This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility).*

#### 	*So, we can use this a simple image to illustrate the connection between them.*
